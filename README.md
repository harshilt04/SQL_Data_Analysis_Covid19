# SQL_Data_Analysis_Covid19

I'm excited to share a recent project where I utilized PostgreSQL to analyze the worldwide effects of COVID-19. 

Leveraging advanced SQL techniques,
uncovered critical insights into the pandemic's impact on a global scale,

Here's a breakdown of what I explored:
○ Key Analyses:
1) Date-wise Likelihood of Dying due to COVID-19 in India : Examined the ratio of total cases to total deaths
over time, providing a temporal view of mortality rates
2) Total % of Deaths Out of Entire Population in India:
Calculated the death rate as a percentage of the
population to understand the broader impact
3) Verification of Death Percentage: Cross-verified the
death percentage by aggregating data from various
sources to ensure accuracy.
4) Country with Highest Deaths as a % of Population
Identified the country with the highest mortality rate
relative to its population.
5) Total % of COVID-19 Positive Cases in India: Assessed
the infection rate within the population.
6) Total % of COVID-19 Positive Cases in the World:
Analyzed the global infection rate for a comprehensive
overyiew.
7) Continent-wise Positive Cases: Broke down the data to
understand regional differences in infection rates
8) Country-wise Total Vaccinated Persons: Evaluated
vaccination efforts across different nations
○ SQL Techniques Employed:
1) Joins: To combine data from multiple tables for a
holistic view.
2) Group By: For aggregating data by specific criteria,
such as date, country, or continent.
3) Max and Average Functions: To find peak values and
average rates, respectively.
4) Subqueries and CTEs: For breaking down complex
queries into manageable parts
Data Science Insights:
This project not only showcases the power of SQL in
handling large datasets but also highlights critical trends
and insights that are crucial for public health strategies
and policy-making. By understanding the nuances of the
data, we can better prepare for future pandemics and
improve our response strategies
